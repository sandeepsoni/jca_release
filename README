Description of the pipeline
=====

If you want to use the code developed for the cultural analytics paper, then you would need to follow the steps below:

1. To train the embeddings model, use the Java code developed by David Bamman [in this repository](https://github.com/dbamman/geoSGLM). 
For the cultural analytics paper, we modified this Java code to emit output embeddings and include an additional facet.
This modification is available in the form of a pull request (as of 3/31/2022) [here](https://github.com/dbamman/geoSGLM/pull/3).

Todo: add a link to dataverse.

If you consider using the code from the repo or the data that's released for this project, please consider citing our paper.

Todo: add bibtex entry

Please contact Sandeep Soni (soni.sandeepb@gmail.com) or Lauren Klein (lklein@gmail.com) for any inquiries about the data or code.
